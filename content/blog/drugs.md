Eric Fromm in his book The Art Of Loving shares that as humans, we are constantly seeking to quench the thirst of separateness and loneliness; that separateness is what breeds anxiety. Many people try to satisfy this need by using drugs and sex. I understand what he meant by that because I am currently going through that phase when I feel so overwhelmed and separated and the next thing that I can think of is either to find a partner or use drugs to cope.

Psilocybin is a trending drug today. After heavy regulations on its research being slightly lifted, scientists have had the chance to research it. Their findings? It is just the perfect drug; no addiction, no withdrawals, and has amazing positive effects on brain function.

When I came up on psilocybin, I was intrigued. Personally, drugs have always been an interesting subject. I have always held the opinion that recreational drugs(real drugs, not caffeine) are dangerous things, and that only people with exceptional self-control should use/try them. What we know from history is that drugs have destroyed even the most passionate and ambitious people. 

I believe we are all-emotional(our emotional self) and not all-rational(our rational self). That is, for every decision we make there is a rational consequence and an accompanying emotional consequence and for the most part, the emotional consequence is what drives our decision making. Unless we know how to control our fleeting emotions, we will constantly make poor decisions which we know we are prone to make when our emotional selves steer our decision making. With drugs the poor decision we are prone to make will be over-indulgence. Based on this reasoning, I am convinced no one should use any recreational drug, regardless of its potential benefits.

What about the proponents of Stoicism who will argue that we have total control over how we react? Yeah, a stoic who also takes drugs? I believe all drugs kill all passion. Even the stoic passion.

To overcome this feeling of separateness, one approach I am open to and advocate for is the total obsession and practice of whatever subject I am enthusiastic of. Finding whatever enthuses you. Treating it like your life depends on it. Rewarding yourself when you make something good. Finding community in whatever you are passionate about. I trust that this kills separateness and loneliness and what's more, you end up creating. It is about unleashing the "little god" in you.
