I know you have tried to wrap your head around how AI systems work many times. This is your third time. The last time you promised to either master it or abandon it altogether.
Well today&rsquo;s a new day. And I think now more than ever you need to understand how this stuff works. Because I trust you have a role in the development of these novo intelligent systems. You learned how to program computers and now I want you to learn how to design and make AI in a year." />

  <p>To myself,</p>
<p>I know you have tried to wrap your head around how AI systems work many times. This is your third time. The last time you promised to either master it or abandon it altogether.</p>
<p>Well today&rsquo;s a new day. And I think now more than ever you need to understand how this stuff works. Because I trust you have a role in the development of these novo intelligent systems. You learned how to program computers and now I want you to learn how to design and make AI in a year.</p>
<p><em>The System</em></p>
<ul>
<li>learn the foundational math in the first 5 months.</li>
<li>learn the teq of ai hands-on with projects.</li>
<li>dive deep into old and new AI research papers.</li>
<li>write about what you are learning fortnightly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I trust you can do this. The reward for mastering AI by Dec 2025: 2 weeks vacation to TZ or RW.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>gitahi</p>
