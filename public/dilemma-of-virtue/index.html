Is it wickedness? Is it weakness? You decide
— Kendrick Lamar

This is a question we must ask ourselves today more than ever: What are our goals and what means will we use to attain them?
It is common knowledge that the world today is cruel and unfair. Every man is more concerned about his own welfare than for the welfare of others. In contemporary society, it is evident that virtue is not rewarded and promoted whereas vice is rewarded and promoted. For instance, gambling and saving. Saving has been punished with low interest rates and high inflation rates. Gambling has been rewarded with promises of winning high jackpots and chronic media endorsement." />

<p>This is a question we must ask ourselves today more than ever: What are our goals and what means will we use to attain them?</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that the world today is cruel and unfair. Every man is more concerned about his own welfare than for the welfare of others. In contemporary society, it is evident that virtue is not rewarded and promoted whereas vice is rewarded and promoted. For instance, gambling and saving. Saving has been punished with low interest rates and high inflation rates. Gambling has been rewarded with promises of winning high jackpots and chronic media endorsement.</p>
<p>Will I choose the path of virtue or vice in attaining my goals? I do not know the answer yet, but I know this internal struggle will shape the person I will become. But maybe the answer lies in finding a balance between the two worlds and knowing when to choose one over the other.</p>
